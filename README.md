# Development Setup

There are definitely ways you can get started with Magento 2 locally, but for a quick and easy way to get you up and running, I will recommend using MAMP.

1. Download and install MAMP locally.
2. Download Magento from it's official website and also "sample data" so that we have a sample store to work with during development.
3. You can easily find a tutorial online on how to get started with Magento using MAMP via Google.
4. Install the Pixlee extension. Use the integration docs at [developers.pixlee.com](https://developers.pixlee.com) for the same.
